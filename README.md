# Giphy-Sample
Sample Java app using Swing and the simple-giphy-java library

###Description
This app uses Swing and the simple-giphy-java library to display a random giphy. This was built in a short amount of time so
if there are any noticable bugs, please let me know. Most likely this app, won't get updated too often, since it is meant
to just be a sample of how to import the simple-giphy-java library and use it in a Java Application.

Note: This app has no test cases so I expect it may be a bit buggy.

###Features
+ Random Giphy at the polling interval
+ Change tag
+ Change Rating
+ Change Polling interval
+ Start app, Stop app and Skip to next Giphy
